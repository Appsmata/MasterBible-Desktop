## What it is

_mBible_ (Master Bible) is a high quality, visual, open source
tool to give users access to the Holy Bible in English and Kiswahili.

Controls and wizards are available for users to:

* Search verses realtime
* Open scriptures real fast and easily
* Switch between languages
* Adjust font types and sizes among other display preferences

## Wiki

For user and developer documentation, check out our Wiki at:

## Nightly builds

Download nightly builds for Windows and OSX here:

* https://nightlies.appsmata.com/latest

## Windows

Download Windows releases here:

* https://Appsmata.com/mBible/#windows

**Note** - If for some reason the standard Windows release does not work
(e.g. gives an error), try a nightly build.  Nightly builds often fix bugs
reported after the last release. :D
