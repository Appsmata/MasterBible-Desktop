## What is vSongBook?
 ... it's an application that gives users access to songs sung in church services among other places where praise and worship is carried out. Major songbooks include Songs of Worship, Nyimbo za Injili, Believers Songs, Redemption Songs and Tenzi za Rohoni. Other songbooks in various local dialects have been added over time and more are under way to be added.

## What it is not ...
... this is not a media player or tutor utility if you don't know how to sing a particular song. Be sure you know to sing most or all of the songs in it, otherwise feel free to customize the songs you want it have for you.
